#A simple node app by Kunal Verma. I have written a shell script to build a golden image using packer, and also terraform file for deployment. These can be done automatically with a single shell script (main.sh) -p flag is for packer image building, -a flag for deployment using terraform and -d flag to destroy provisioned items via terraform. -a and -d flags are not to be used together.
